            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In his memoir, <em>Born To Run</em>, Bruce Springsteen writes of his frustrations in getting the sound in his head down on tape in the <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em> sessions:</p>

<p>"… you can’t feature everything, for in effect you’re featuring nothing. Phil Spector’s records aren’t sonically big. The technology wasn’t there. They just sound bigger than your world. It’s a beautiful illusion.”</p>

<p>This is something we’ve been slowly learning, as we blunder our way through making recordings of our music. In fact, it appears that if you pursue technical “perfection" too much, you can easily break this illusion. It’s a vision through a dirty and clouded window, where the fogginess is part of the picture. Clean that window too much and the spectacle doesn’t have the same effect. Distortion can make a vocal larger than life, compression causes drums to explode.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Here at Automatic Panic towers, or, if you like, Panic Station, we enjoy doing things ourselves. We write our own songs and then play, record, mix them ourselves as well as shoot most of our videos ourselves. </p>

<p>While we make our music, photos, and videos available on the various commonly-used "platforms", we try not to depend entirely on any one of them. This website is simply an extension of that attitude. It's our little haven, our patch of virtual land where we can do everything our own way.</p>

<p>So feel free to make use of the original web "platform", the web itself: bookmark this site, add <a href="/blog/feed">our RSS feed</a>, or <a href="/subscribe.html">subscribe</a> to our mailing list. We'll do our best to keep you entertained.</p>

            <p><em>Altered States</em> is dedicated to history.</p>

<p>History is a soothsayer, a shaman, an oracle. It shows us its alter egos, worlds that are part of our own but yet lie behind it. The worlds have always lived in conflict. They are the meta-physical manifestation of doubt.</p>

<p>I doubt and therefore I am. But also, one who does not doubt cannot be.</p>

<p>The certain ones, the zealots with no doubts, they are are un-making the world, tearing at the facade to show the forces that lie beneath. They are un-making the world to show that its pieces never really fit together in the first place.</p>

<p>History is replayed repeatedly.</p>
