            Intoxication. Whether it is lust, power, devotion, or good old fashioned liquor, there is something that
            holds this power over all of us. We crave it, we fear it, and we can hate ourselves because of it. This
            theme of intoxication runs through many strands of music ranging from from Rock ’n’ Roll, Hip-Hop, even
            religious Qawwali music. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>All My Crimes</em> is an attempt to add to this canon with everything turned up to 11. Long a mainstay
            of our
            live shows, the recorded version has been overdue for some time. The challenge was to capture the essence of
            this song with its almighty drums, buzzing guitars, and shredded lead vocals.

            We like to keep it simple so there isn’t anything else going on except those drums, drop-D guitars, and a
            handful of vocal overdubs but this song’s emotional and dynamic range proved difficult to capture
            effectively. After <em>a lot</em> of mixes, it’s our pleasure to bring you this exclusive release at last.
            Turn it
            up!

            <blockquote class="ep-text">
                Some days I get mixed up on why, <br> The days she’s fixed up, my oh my, <br> I can’t tell no lies. <br>
                My mind drinks in the smoke she blows, <br>Pour the wine - begins to flow, <br> It just goes to show
                <br> <br> They say don’t drink that bottle dry <br> But I never knew the reason why <br> <br> When she
                gets that dress skin tight <br> Yeah, we don’t know wrong from right. <br> What she whispers out of
                sight, <br> Yeah it blows my mind. <br> Confess and pay for all my crimes, <br> Yeah, yeah, one more
                time. <br> <br> I’ll lose myself and taste the sweetest sin, <br> Make a break and get drawn back in.
                <br> But there’s no way I can win. <br> She’ll draw the secret out of me, <br> Drag it out for everyone
                to
                see. <br> How she’s waited patiently. <br> <br> They say don’t drink that bottle dry, <br> Give me a
                reason
                not to try. <br> <br> When she gets that dress skin tight <br> Yeah, we don’t know wrong from
                right. <br> What she whispers out of sight, <br> Yeah it blows my mind. <br> Confess and pay for all my
                crimes, <br> Yeah, yeah, one more time. <br> <br> I’d better leave some things unsaid, <br> For the
                guilty thoughts that roam my head, <br> I could wind up dead. <br> Some nights I just can’t help myself,
                <br> Take a drink and drown my health. <br> She takes me by stealth. <br> <br> At night I drink that
                bottle dry, <br> I never knew the reason why. <br> <br> When she gets that dress skin tight <br> Yeah,
                we
                don’t know wrong from right. <br> What she whispers out of sight, <br> Yeah it blows my mind. <br>
                Confess and pay for all my crimes, <br> Yeah, yeah, one more time.
