            It’s an upside down world. We have been rendered voiceless by those who would give us voice. We have
            turned
            the spaces between us into chasms while a plague beat down our door. We have been led astray by false
            masters, bereft of the language needed to resist them. We inflated words like party balloons until they
            burst and became meaningless.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is in such a world where a man can speak without moving his lips or a woman can walk without use of
            her
            legs. There are no words left to lift the surprise of such events above mundane ones. If everything is
            shocking, nothing is.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Words To Say (Dialogue)</em> is a depiction of this world, one in which tension is being ratcheted
            slowly and surely. In our
            minds, we know these things to be true but allow those thoughts to coexist uneasily with thoughts of
            acceptance, much like how the clean guitar keeps an uneasy truce with the distorted one on opposite
            sides of
            the stereo spectrum. At some point, however, there will be a snap, a rupture, and we will have to begin
            again.

            Self-recorded at home, like all of our music, we think this song has pushed our production, songwriting,
            and
            performance abilities into new territory. We hope you agree and we look forward to hearing what you
            think!

            <blockquote class="ep-text">
                I saw a man the other day, <br> His lips were moving. <br> But he had gone another way <br> Of his own
                choosing. <br> <br> He asked a question, <br> With no reply. <br> Mind-abusing. <br> <br> Was he, was he
                even here? <br> Was he, was he ever near? <br> <br> He left to find out yesterday <br> But somehow he
                got lost along the way <br> And nobody knows <br> The words to say. <br> <br> I saw you walking the
                other night <br> But your legs weren’t moving. <br> I wonder at the sight <br> Most confusing. <br> <br>
                I won’t, I won’t shed a tear <br> And I won’t, I won’t say it clear. <br> <br> I left to find you
                yesterday <br> But somehow I got lost along the way <br> With another master to obey. <br> And I don’t
                know <br> The words to say. <br> <br> I should have wondered yesterday <br> If the spell I’m under went
                away. <br> Just another master to obey. <br> And I don’t know <br> The words to say. </blockquote>
