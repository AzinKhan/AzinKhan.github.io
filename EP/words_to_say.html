            Itâ€™s an upside down world. We have been rendered voiceless by those who would give us voice. We have turned
            the spaces between us into chasms while a plague beat down our door. We have been led astray by false
            masters, bereft of the language needed to resist them. We inflated words like party balloons until they
            burst and became meaningless.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is in such a world where a man can speak without moving his lips or a woman can walk without use of her
            legs. There are no words left to lift the surprise of such events above mundane ones. If everything is
            shocking, nothing is.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Words To Say (Dialogue)</em> is a depiction of this world, one in which tension is being ratcheted slowly and surely. In our
            minds, we know these things to be true but allow those thoughts to coexist uneasily with thoughts of
            acceptance, much like how the clean guitar keeps an uneasy truce with the distorted one on opposite sides of
            the stereo spectrum. At some point, however, there will be a snap, a rupture, and we will have to begin
            again.
            <br>
            <br>
            Self-recorded at home, like all of our music, we think this song has pushed our production, songwriting, and
            performance abilities into new territory. We hope you agree and we look forward to hearing what you think!
