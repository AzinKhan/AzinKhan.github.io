            We all have people we’ll bleed for. But sometimes we mix up the cause and the effect. We think that we can
            win someone over if we can show what we’re willing to go through for their sake. Excruciatingly, we turn the
            screw, ratchet up the tension, and hope that a thunderbolt will strike from blue skies.
            <br>
            <br>
            And in <em>Heartbleed</em>’s rock ’n’ roll fantasy, the bolt strikes true, if only for a little while.
            Because,
            ultimately, we can’t continue this way. Eventually we have to give up this masochistic game in order to save
            ourselves. Our hearts can only bleed so much.
            <br>
            <br>
            This song injects a bit of medicinal mayhem into our repertoire. It follows the arc of foolish desire,
            excitement, and then back again (if a little weary). We doom ourselves into demonstrating our savage
            fidelity to someone new whenever it fails to enchant our previous target.

            <em>Heartbleed</em> was a joy to produce, from recording to the final mix. It captures much of what is
            essential to
            our sound and we hope you enjoy it as much as we have.
