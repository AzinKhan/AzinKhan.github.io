            Sometimes life just comes at you again and again, with only moments of calm in between. It’s like being lost at sea. <em>Terra Firma</em> tries to capture this with a track that washes over you like waves in the ocean. The sections in between the crashing waves are moments of uneasy calm as the meter and the key shift underneath you like the shifting currents of the open water.<br><br>The thing is, when you’re lost and you’re simply being carried wherever life is taking you, it’s possible to become resigned to it and even embrace it. If the horizon brings a new person to your rescue, you might view them with suspicion. Are they taking you hostage? Will you allow yourself to be vulnerable? Did you call them into your life? Do you accept their answers to your questions? The longer you’re aboard your lost vessel, the more you forget what it’s like not to be alone. Solid ground is just a spectre, a beautiful nightmare.

        From the same recording sessions as <em>All My Crimes</em>, <em>Terra Firma</em> is another older stalwart of our live sets so it gives us great pleasure to introduce its definitive recorded version. Let us know what you think!
